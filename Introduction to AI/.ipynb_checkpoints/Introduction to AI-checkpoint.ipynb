    "## Impact of AI on future jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the world around us, and the job market is no exception. Its impact on future jobs is a complex and multifaceted issue, with both potential benefits and drawbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Job displacement**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    One of the primary concerns surrounding AI is its potential to automate many existing jobs, particularly those involving routine and repetitive tasks. This could lead to significant job losses in sectors like manufacturing, transportation, and data entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "  <img src=\"Images/ai_jobs.png\" alt=\"Alt Text\" width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Job creation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    However, AI also creates new job opportunities in fields like AI development, data science, cybersecurity, and robotics. These jobs require skills in areas like programming, machine learning, and data analysis, which are in high demand and will continue to be in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "  <img src=\"Images/ai_jobs2.png\" alt=\"Alt Text\" width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Job transformation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Perhaps the most significant impact of AI will be on the transformation of existing jobs. AI will augment human capabilities, allowing us to work faster, smarter, and more efficiently. This will require workers to adapt and develop new skills to collaborate effectively with AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "  <img src=\"Images/ai_jobs3.png\" alt=\"Alt Text\" width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall, the impact of AI on future jobs is likely to be mixed**. While some jobs will be lost to automation, others will be created, and many existing jobs will be transformed. The key to success in the future job market will be adaptability, a willingness to learn new skills, and a focus on developing skills that AI cannot easily replicate, such as creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some additional points to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The pace of AI adoption will vary across industries and countries. Some sectors, such as technology and healthcare, are likely to be more affected than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The impact of AI on jobs will depend on the level of education and skills required for the job. Jobs requiring higher education and skills are less likely to be automated.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Governments and policymakers will need to play a role in supporting workers who are displaced by AI and helping them develop the skills they need for the future job market.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding the potential impact of AI on jobs, we can better prepare for the future and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to thrive in the new AI-powered economy.\n",

    "## Introduction to AI Workflows (DL focused workflows).\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning workflows are the structured processes involved in building, training, and deploying deep learning models to solve real-world problems. These workflows can be complex and involve various tools and techniques, but understanding their core stages is crucial for any aspiring deep learning practitioner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the key steps involved in a typical deep-learning workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **Fueling the Engine:** Your journey begins with acquiring the right data, the fuel for your deep learning engine. This might involve gathering images, text, sensor readings, or any other relevant information for your specific task.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    * **Data Cleaning and Wrangling:** Raw data is rarely ready for the AI feast. You'll need to clean it by removing errors, inconsistencies, and outliers. Think of it as washing and chopping the vegetables before cooking!\n",
    "      \n",
    "    * **Feature Engineering:** Sometimes, you might need to transform your data to create new features that better capture the relevant information for your model. This is like adding spices to enhance the flavor of your dish.\n",
    "\n",
    "  <img src=\"Images/data_clean.png\" alt=\"Alt Text\" width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Building and Training:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "    * **Choosing the Right Architecture:** Now comes the exciting part: building your deep learning model! This involves selecting the appropriate architecture, like a convolutional neural network for image recognition or a recurrent neural network for language processing. Think of it as choosing the right recipe for your desired outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Training the Model:** Once your architecture is ready, it's time to train it on your prepped data. This involves feeding the data through the network and adjusting its internal parameters to learn the underlying patterns and relationships. Imagine patiently teaching your model to recognize the perfect dish from its ingredients and cooking process.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Training isn't just about feeding data; it's about finding the optimal settings for your model's internal parameters, called hyperparameters. Think of it as adjusting the oven temperature and cooking time to achieve the perfect texture and flavor.\n",
    "\n",
    "  <img src=\"Images/model_building.jpg\" alt=\"Alt Text\" width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluation and Refinement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Testing and Validation:** Once your model is trained, it's time to test its performance on unseen data. This helps assess itsgeneralizability and identify areas for improvement. Imagine presenting your dish to a panel of discerning critics for feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Error Analysis and Refinement:** Based on the test results, you might need to refine your model by adjusting the architecture, hyperparameters, or even acquiring more data. This iterative process is like perfecting your recipe based on the feedback, ensuring your dish is truly exceptional.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Deployment and Monitoring:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Putting Your Model to Work:** Finally, the moment arrives to deploy your trained model into the real world! This could involve integrating it into a software application, website, or even a physical device. Think of it as serving your masterpiece to the eager diners, ready to be savored.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Continuous Monitoring:** Deployment isn't the end of the journey. You need to continuously monitor your model's performance in the real world and be prepared to adapt and refine it as needed. Imagine checking on your dish after serving, ensuring it retains its deliciousness over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "  <img src=\"Images/model_deployment.png\" alt=\"Alt Text\" width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Additional Considerations:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "    * **Version control and reproducibility:** Maintain proper version control of your code and data to track changes and ensure the reproducibility of your results.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    * **Documentation and communication:** Document your workflow steps, choices, and findings to facilitate collaboration and future improvements.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    * **Ethical considerations:** Be mindful of potential biases in your data and model, and ensure your deep learning solution aligns with ethical principles.\n",
